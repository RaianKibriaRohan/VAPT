# :mag: Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)  

## :pushpin: Project Overview  
This project focuses on performing **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** on a **Metasploitable 2 machine**, using **Nessus for scanning** and **Metasploit for exploitation**.  

## :zap: Steps Performed  
1. **Scanning & Vulnerability Assessment** ‚Äì Used **Nessus** to analyze security vulnerabilities.  
2. **Exploitation** ‚Äì Used **Metasploit** to exploit identified vulnerabilities.  
3. **Post-Exploitation** ‚Äì Gained a shell, analyzed security risks and documented findings.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- **Nessus** ‚Äì Vulnerability scanning & assessment  
- **Metasploit Framework** ‚Äì Exploitation & payload delivery  
- **Kali Linux** ‚Äì Ethical hacking environment  

## :dart: Key Takeaways  
- Learned **real-world vulnerability assessment techniques**  
- Understood **common security flaws in networked systems**  
- Explored **penetration testing methodologies**
